	## Financial Literacy?
	
	Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.

	When you are financially literate, you have the essential foundation for a smart relationship with money. This can help start a lifelong journey of learning about the financial aspects of your life. The earlier you start to become financially literate, 
	the better off you'll be because education is the key to a successful financial future.
	
	### Key Takeaways
	The term ‚Äúfinancial literacy‚Äù refers to understanding a variety of important financial skills and concepts.
	Financially literate people are generally less vulnerable to financial fraud.
	A strong foundation of financial literacy can help support various life goals, such as saving for education or retirement, using debt responsibly, and running a business.
	Key aspects of financial literacy include knowing how to create a budget, plan for retirement, manage debt, and track personal spending.
	Financial literacy can be obtained through reading books, listening to podcasts, subscribing to financial content, or talking to a financial professional.



	### Why Financial Literacy Matters
	#### It Supports Financial Well-Being
	Day-to-day living expenses, living within your means, short-term borrowing, long-term budget forecasting. To manage these and other essential financial realities properly as you go through life, you must be financially literate.

	It is important to plan and save enough to provide adequate income in retirement while avoiding high levels of debt that might result in bankruptcy, defaults, and foreclosures.

	In its "Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2022" report, the U.S. Federal Reserve System Board of Governors found that many Americans are not prepared for retirement. Twenty-eight percent indicated that they have no retirement savings, while about 31% of those not yet retired felt that their retirement savings were on track. Among those who have self-directed retirement savings, about 63% admitted to feeling low levels of confidence in making retirement decisions.
	3

	#### Millennials' Challenge
	Lack of financial literacy has left millennials‚Äîthe largest share of the American workforce‚Äîunprepared for a severe financial crisis, according to research by the TIAA Institute. Even among those who reported having a high knowledge of personal finance, only 19% answered questions about fundamental financial concepts correctly.
	4

	Forty-three percent reported using expensive alternative financial services, such as payday loans and pawnshops. More than half lacked an emergency fund to cover three months‚Äô of expenses, and 37% were financially fragile (defined as unable or unlikely to be able to come up with $2,000 within a month in the event of an emergency).
	4

	Millennials also carry large amounts of student loan and mortgage debt. In fact, 44% of them said they have too much debt.
	5

	Though these may seem like individual problems, they have a wider effect on the entire population than previously believed. The lack of knowledge of mortgage products prior to the 2008 financial crisis created widespread vulnerability to predatory lending. The financial impact of that crisis affected the entire economy.

	Financial literacy is an issue with broad implications for economic health.

	### Benefits of Financial Literacy
	Broadly speaking, the benefit of financial literacy is that it empowers individuals to make smarter decisions about their finances. In addition:

	Financial literacy can prevent devastating financial mistakes: Floating rate loans may have different interest rates each month, while traditional individual retirement account (IRA) contributions can‚Äôt be withdrawn until retirement. For someone unaware of these and other financial facts, seemingly innocent financial decisions may have long-term implications that cost them money or impact life plans. Financial literacy helps individuals avoid making mistakes with their personal finances.
	
	Financial literacy prepares people for financial emergencies: Topics such as saving or emergency preparedness get individuals ready for uncertain times. Though losing a job or having a major unexpected expense can be financially impactful, an individual can cushion the blow by saving regularly.
	
	Financial literacy can help individuals reach their goals: By better understanding how to budget and save money, individuals can create plans that define expectations, hold them accountable to their finances, and set a course for achieving important financial goals. Though someone may not be able to afford a dream today, they can create a plan that can help make it happen.
	
	Financial literacy gives rise to confidence: Imagine having to make a life-changing financial decision without all the necessary information. With knowledge about finances, individuals can approach major life choices with greater confidence. They'll be more likely to achieve the outcome they desire and less likely to be surprised or negatively impacted by unforeseen outcomes.
	
	### Strategies to Improve Financial Literacy Skills
	Developing financial literacy involves learning and practicing skills related to budgeting, managing, and paying off debts, and more. It means understanding and using credit and investment products wisely. The good news is that, no matter where you are in life and financially, it‚Äôs never too late to start practicing good financial habits.

	Here are several practical strategies to consider.

	#### 1.Create a Budget
	Track how much money you receive each month and how much you spend. You can use an Excel spreadsheet, paper, or a budgeting app. Your budget should include income (paychecks, investments, alimony), fixed expenses (rent/mortgage payments, utilities, loan payments), discretionary spending (nonessentials such as eating out, shopping, and travel), and savings. Pairing your budget with an expense tracking app can help identify where you are spending each month and where you might be able to save.

	#### 2.Pay Yourself First
	To build savings, this reverse budgeting strategy involves choosing a savings goal, such as paying for higher education, deciding how much you want to contribute toward it each month, and setting that amount aside before you divvy up the rest of your expenses.

	#### 3.Pay Bills Promptly
	Stay on top of monthly bills, making sure that your payments are always sent to arrive on time. Consider taking advantage of automatic debits from a checking account or bill-pay apps, and sign up for payment reminders (by email, phone, or text).

	#### 4.Get Your Credit Report
	Once a year, consumers can request a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus‚ÄîEquifax, Experian, and TransUnion‚Äîthrough the federally created website AnnualCreditReport.com.
	6

	Review these reports and dispute any errors by informing the credit bureau of inaccuracies. Because you can get three of them, consider spacing out your requests throughout the year to monitor your credit regularly.

	In a 2022 survey by the Federal Reserve, 27% of adults in the U.S. reported not "doing okay" financially. The number who reported not living comfortably increased from 2021.
	7
	#### 5.Check Your Credit Score
	A good credit score enables you to obtain the best interest rates on loans and credit cards, among other benefits. Monitor your score via a free credit monitoring service. Or, if you can afford to and want to add an extra layer of protection for your personal information, use a credit monitoring service. In addition, be aware of what can raise or lower your scores, such as credit inquiries and credit utilization ratios.

	#### 6.Manage Debt
	Use your budget to stay on top of debt by reducing spending and increasing repayment. Develop a debt reduction plan, such as paying down the loan with the highest interest rate first. If your debt is excessive, contact lenders to renegotiate repayment, consolidate loans, or find a debt counseling program.

	#### 7.Invest in Your Future
	If your employer offers a 401(k) retirement savings account, be sure to sign up and contribute the maximum to receive the employer match. Consider opening an IRA and creating a diversified investment portfolio of stocks, fixed income, and commodities. If necessary, seek financial advice from professional advisors to help you determine how much money you will need to retire comfortably and develop strategies to reach your goal.
